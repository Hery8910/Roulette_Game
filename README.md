# Roulette Game Project

## Introduction

This project was a challenging yet rewarding experience that significantly enhanced my understanding of data flow and file organization to create scalable and easy-to-understand applications. The Roulette Game is the final project for the Basic Programming module at "DCI". It integrates multiple aspects of JavaScript programming, including user input handling, dynamic content display, and terminal-based interactivity.

## Project Overview

The Roulette Game is a console-based application that simulates a roulette wheel game. Players can place bets on numbers, and the game randomly generates a winning number for each round, highlighting it on a visually represented roulette table.

### Features

- **Dynamic Roulette Table**: The game presents a horizontally oriented roulette table that updates in real-time.
- **User Input Handling**: Players are prompted to place their bets through the console.
- **Random Number Generation**: Each round generates a random winning number that is highlighted on the table.
- **Player Interaction**: Supports multiple players, alternating turns and accepting bets.
- **Clear Instructions and Feedback**: Provides clear instructions to players and feedback after each round.


### Dependencies

- **chalk**: Used for coloring and styling the terminal output.
- **cli-table3**: Utilized for creating and formatting the roulette table in the console.
- **readline-sync**: Handles synchronous user input for a smooth interaction experience.


### How to Run the Game
- Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:   npm install
- Start the Game: node script.js
- Have fun!!
